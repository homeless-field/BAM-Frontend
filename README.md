# Set-Up Guide
Getting everything set up is not a trivial task. If you're very technical, it's not the most difficult thing in the world, but if you aren't it isn't super easy. This guide only covers Windows 10 and VS Code. For help, feel free to ask in the club's [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dw8dHZEDmu), contact an officer from the club, or contact Ashton Gibson in-person, [on GitHub](https://github.com/homeless-field), or on Discord (@pibto).
### 1. Set Up GitHub
#### [Skip This Step](#set-up-github-desktop)
The club uses GitHub to host the app's code, so the first thing you'll need to set up is an account. Visit [GitHub's sign-up page](https://github.com/signup) and follow the prompts. Congratulations! You've already completed the first step!

### 2. Set Up GitHub Desktop
#### [Skip This Step]()
Before installing GitHub Desktop, you'll also need to install Git, a command-line tool. Visit their [install page](https://git-scm.com/download/win), and choose the option for your system. Most likely, that's "64-bit Git for Windows Setup". Then go to your downloads folder and click the .exe file, and follow the prompts. Git is a _very_ complex program, so here's my advice:
1. Don't change the install location
2. For the default editor, use Visual Studio Code
3. If you don't know what something means, it's probably best to click Next
     
If you aren't sure about something, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsNsYvYDyTc) is a quick summary, but there's plenty of resources online to help.
