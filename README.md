# Set-Up Guide
Getting everything set up is not a trivial task. It might take a few hours if you aren't already comfortable with GitHub and VS Code. It's not the easiest thing on the planet, but the best things in life never are. :) This guide only covers Windows 10 and VS Code. For help, feel free to ask in the club's [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dw8dHZEDmu), contact an officer from the club, or contact Ashton Gibson in-person, [on GitHub](https://github.com/homeless-field), or on Discord (@pibto).
### The basic steps are:
1. [Set Up GitHub](#set-up-github)
2. [Set Up GitHub Desktop](#set-up-github-desktop)
3. [Set Up Android Studio](#set-up-android-studio)
4. [Set Up VS Code](#set-up-vs-code)
5. 

### 1. Set Up GitHub
The club uses GitHub to host the app's code, so the first thing you'll need to set up is an account. Visit [GitHub's sign-up page](https://github.com/signup) and follow the prompts. Congratulations! You've already completed the first step!

### 2. Set Up GitHub Desktop
Before installing GitHub Desktop, you'll also need to install Git, a command-line tool. Visit their [install page](https://git-scm.com/download/win), and choose the option for your system. Most likely, that's "64-bit Git for Windows Setup". Then go to your downloads folder and click the .exe file, and follow the prompts. Git is a _very_ complex program, so here's my advice:
1. Don't change the install location
2. For the default editor, use Visual Studio Code
3. If you don't know what something means, it's probably best to click Next
     
If you aren't sure about something, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsNsYvYDyTc) is a quick summary, but there's plenty of resources online to help. To test and see if Git installed correctly press the Windows key and type "cmd", open your command prompt, and type "git" then enter. If you get a response other than "Git is not recognized as an internal or external command", it's installed correctly! Otherwise, it's likely that Git didn't install to your path. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt9oDAvpG4I) from 1:40 to 3:00 can help to fix that.

And now we can _finally_ install GitHub Desktop itself. To start, visit their [home page](https://desktop.github.com) and click the install button. From there, go to your downloads folder and click the .exe file, and follow the prompts to ensure it's installed where you want. When it's done, launch the program and log in with your GitHub account. For more detail, visit their ["Getting Started" page](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

### 3. Set Up Android Studio
Yes, you'll need Android Studio even if you have an iPhone and/or a Mac. You won't actually be using it, but Flutter needs it for some stuff. If you're technical, you can also install _just_ the Android SDK [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#command-line-tools-only), but this guide can't help set it up. To begin, visit their [install page](https://developer.android.com/studio), open the .exe, and follow the prompts. Leave the Android SDK component enabled. Install Android Studio wherever you want, but make sure to leave the Android SDK installation location as the default. Also choose the standard install options unless you know what you're doing. Once you're at the screen with options to start a new project or open an existing one, you can close the program and never have to open it again. If you have issues installing Android Studio, they have an [official guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).

### 4. Set Up VS Code
The hard part's over now! VS Code is where you'll be actually writing your Flutter code. This type of software is called an IDE, if you want to research some alternatives. To install VS Code, though, visit their [install page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), open the .exe, and follow the prompts. This is the last install, I swear! The process is relatively simple, and you can install it wherever you choose. If you need a visual guide, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxJXKFxhah4) is helpful.

### 5. Enable the Flutter Extension
